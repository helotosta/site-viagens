# Travel Agency Site

  
Hi! This is my first website project using basic HTML and CSS concepts.

The main goals here were to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

Nice things that  be learned from this project:

- Flexbox basics concepts, like:
  -  Flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
- How to integrate with google maps
	- The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that i used google maps integration and documentation.
- Media queries
	 - All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
